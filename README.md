# 1.Business/Real-world problem
## 1.1 What is malware?
<b>Ans:</b>The term malware is a contraction of malicious software.malware is any piece of software that was written with the intent of 
damaging devices, stealing data, and generally causing a mess.

## 1.2. Problem Statement
In the past few years, the malware industry has grown very rapidly that, the syndicates invest heavily in technologies to evade traditional
protection, forcing the anti-malware groups/communities to build more robust softwares to detect and terminate these attacks.
The major part of protecting a computer system from a malware attack is<b> to identify whether a given piece of file/software is a malware.
</b>
## 1.3 Source/Useful Links
Microsoft has been very active in building anti-malware products over the years and it runs itâ€™s anti-malware utilities over 150 million 
computers around the world. This generates tens of millions of daily data points to be analyzed as potential malware. In order to be 
effective in analyzing and classifying such large amounts of data, we need to be able to group them into groups and identify their 
respective families.

This dataset provided by Microsoft contains about 9 classes of malware.

## 1.4. Real-world/Business objectives and constraints:
1. Minimize multi-class error.
2. Multi-class probability estimates.
3. Malware detection should not take hours and block the user's computer. It should fininsh in a few seconds or a minute.
## 2. Machine Learning Problem
### 2.1. Data
#### 2.1.1. Data Overview
<b>Source :</b> https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification/data

For every malware, we have two files

1. .asm file (read more: https://www.reviversoft.com/file-extensions/asm)
2. .bytes file (the raw data contains the hexadecimal representation of the file's binary content, without the PE header)

Total train dataset consist of 200GB data out of which 50Gb of data is .bytes files and 150GB of data is .asm files

<b>Lots of Data for a single-box/computer.</b>

There are total 10,868 .bytes files and 10,868 asm files total 21,736 files

There are 9 types of malwares (9 classes) in our give data

<b>Types of Malware:</b>
1. Ramnit
2. Lollipop
3. Kelihos_ver3
4. Vundo
5. Simda
6. Tracur
7. Kelihos_ver1
8. Obfuscator.ACY
9. Gatak

### 2.2. Mapping the real-world problem to an ML problem

#### 2.2.1. Type of Machine Learning Problem

There are nine different classes of malware that we need to classify a given a data point => Multi class classification problem

#### 2.2.2. Performance Metric

<b>Source:</b> https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification#evaluation

<b>Metric(s):</b>

* Multi class log-loss
* Confusion matrix
#### 2.2.3. Machine Learing Objectives and Constraints
<b>Objective:</b> Predict the probability of each data-point belonging to each of the nine classes.

<b>Constraints:</b>

1. Class probabilities are needed.
2. Penalize the errors in class probabilites => Metric is Log-loss.
3. Some Latency constraints.

### 2.3. Train and Test Dataset

Split the dataset randomly into three parts train, cross validation and test with 64%,16%, 20% of data respectively
